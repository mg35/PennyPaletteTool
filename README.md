# PennyPaletteTool
This is a tool that allows you to swap the palettes of the models in Penny's Big Breakaway. First, make sure you are running the game in [Data Folder Mode](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/17262). Then, when you run this tool you should see the dropdowns on the left side populated with the mesh folder and file names. Use those dropdowns to choose a file to edit. If it is a gradient mesh (and do be warned that some files are not), the right side of the window will be populated with a list of that model's palettes. On the right you will have more dropdowns to allow you to choose a new palette to substitute for the original one. Press "Save Palettes" to update the model file. You should see the updates in-game when you return to the level select and enter a new level.
